# Ghost Mod
Just like in a racing game where you see your previous best as a ghost - same thing but in GR with Kevin as the ghost.
- Supports all levels, all cybervoids including Killruns.
- Best combined with MovementMod.
- Can you share ghostdata with others? yes.

**Controls:** 
- key 0  - Removes ghostdata for current map.
